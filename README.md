# Mini responsive web design project

1-page portfolio site landing page - designed using AdobeXD

This is my first project where I used AdobeXD - I created this design to learn and practice the designing element of web development and gain more experience with AdobeXD.

Fully responsive design using CSS grid and flexbox only
